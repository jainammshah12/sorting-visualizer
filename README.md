# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer 
This is a personal project visualizing important sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort to understand how these actually work and give a good idea of how fast they really are. 
It is deployed here: https://jainammshah12.github.io/sorting-visualizer/ (Best seen on desktop Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome)

## Next Steps
As a developer, I look towards adding more features and sorting algorithms in the near future.
